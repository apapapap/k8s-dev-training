### Qemu-img
- QEMU is defined as a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. This means that Qemu can be used as machine emulator to run Operating systems and programs for one machine on a different machine. An example is running ARM program on x86 PC. In this case, QEMU can use other hypervisors like Xen or KVM for CPU extensions, to achieve what is commonly referred to as Hardware Assisted Virtualization

- QEMU performance is better than Virtual Box 

- qemu-img allows you to create, convert and modify images offline. It can handle all image formats supported by QEMU.
	   
- qemu-img is the command line utility thatâ€™s used to convert various file systems used by hypervisors like Xen, KVM, VMware, VirtualBox. qemu-img is used to format guest images, add additional storage devices and network storage e.t.c. 

### libguestfs
- libguestfs is a set of tools for accessing and modifying virtual machine (VM) disk images. You can use this for viewing and editing files inside guests, scripting changes to VMs, monitoring disk used/free statistics, creating guests, P2V, V2V, performing backups, cloning VMs, building VMs, formatting disks, resizing disks, and much more.

### QCOW2 file
- A QCOW2 file is a disk image saved in the second version of the QEMU Copy On Write (QCOW2) format, which is used by QEMU virtualization software. It stores the hard drive contents of a QEMU virtual machine. 
- You can mount a QCOW2 disk image and use it to create a virtual machine in QEMU (cross-platform) and some other virtualization programs.

### Backing chain
- Backing chain is like taking a snapshot in of the current state of the virtual machine.
- Backing files and overlays are extremely useful to rapidly instantiate thin-privisoned virtual machines.
- It is quite useful in development & test environments, so that one could quickly revert to a known state & discard the overlay.
